## Post-Budget Reflections: *Growth on Hold?* 

  - What is Pakistan stabilising *from*?
  - Who bears the cost of prolonged stabilisation?
  - Can we afford to delay growth?
- Krugman’s View: “Austerity in a depression is a trap — the more you cut, the weaker your economy becomes.”

::: notes


- **What is Pakistan stabilising *from*?**
  - Years of twin deficits: high fiscal and current account imbalances
  - Rapid reserve depletion in 2022–23 and exchange rate volatility
  - Mounting debt repayments and IMF program conditions
  - Inflation driven by supply shocks, energy tariffs, and monetisation

- **Who bears the cost of prolonged stabilisation?**
  - **Households**: Rising food, fuel, and utility prices with stagnant incomes
  - **Small businesses**: Sluggish demand, costly borrowing, regulatory uncertainty
  - **Youth & job-seekers**: Limited job creation and fewer opportunities in shrinking formal sectors
  - **Public sector**: Development projects slowed or suspended; service delivery under strain

- **Can we afford to delay growth?**
  - A delayed recovery compounds informalisation and poverty
  - Lost economic momentum undermines tax base, productivity, and investor confidence
  - Risk of a low-growth trap where stabilisation becomes a permanent condition

- > **Krugman’s Insight**: “Austerity in a depression is a trap — the more you cut, the weaker your economy becomes.”
  - When aggregate demand is already low, cutting public spending only worsens contraction
  - Fiscal consolidation without investment guarantees is self-defeating

- **Why this matters in Pakistan now**:
  - With inflation receding and primary surplus achieved, the question is:
    **Can the state now pivot from preservation to preparation?**

##  The Budget and Its Priorities

- **What it emphasizes**:
  - IMF targets met: primary surplus, tax revenues, currency management
  - Cuts in development spending, restraint in wage hikes
- **What it ignores**:
  - Weak job creation
  - Productivity stagnation
  - Rising energy costs without sectoral relief
- A stabilising budget — but not a stimulating one.

::: notes

- **What it emphasizes**:
  - **IMF Conditionality Fulfilled**: The budget secures key benchmarks — including a **primary fiscal surplus**, improved **tax-to-GDP ratio**, and **exchange rate flexibility** — keeping Pakistan on track for the next IMF tranche.
  - **Revenue-First Approach**: Sharp focus on **indirect taxes** (e.g., GST on essentials, petroleum levy), **broadening the tax base** (especially documentation of the retail and real estate sectors), and digitisation of FBR.
  - **Austerity in Development**: Significant **cuts in Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP)** allocations — many CPEC projects, water infrastructure, and regional development schemes are deferred.
  - **Restrained Salary Growth**: Minimal increases in public sector wages and pensions despite high inflation — real incomes of civil servants and pensioners effectively shrink.

- **What it ignores**:
  - **Employment Crisis**: Budget lacks a **clear employment generation strategy**; no sector-specific incentives for SMEs, agri-based manufacturing, or services expansion.
  - **Productivity Gaps**: No meaningful investment in **R&D**, **skills training**, or **value-added industry** — sectors that could lift total factor productivity remain underfunded.
  - **Energy Burden**: Rising electricity and fuel prices passed on to consumers and businesses without **tariff rationalisation**, **efficiency reforms**, or **targeted relief for energy-intensive sectors**.

- **Verdict**:
  - This is a **budget of macroeconomic restraint**, not one of structural reform or inclusive growth.
  - It may **stabilise the books**, but it does not **stimulate confidence, employment, or enterprise**.
  - As Krugman warned in global contexts, **austerity during recovery weakens the engine before it even starts.**

## The Logic of Stabilisation in Pakistan

- **Why stabilise?**
  - FX pressure from imports & debt repayments
  - Prevent default & restore investor confidence
  - Anchor inflation expectations
- **What’s missing**:
  - Long-term recovery path
  - Role of state in rebuilding market confidence
  - Growth guarantees for key sectors (SMEs, exports, agriculture)

---

## Krugman's Austerity Trap — Pakistan Version

- **Krugman’s Argument**:
  - Austerity deepens recessions when applied during downturns.
  - Government spending *is* a stabiliser, not a threat.
- **Pakistani Parallel**:
  - Fiscal cuts reduce public investment → worsens unemployment
  - Private sector hesitant → no crowd-in effect
  - Stabilisation becomes stagnation

---

##  Growth Pressures on the Ground

- **Labour Market Stress**:
  - Youth bulge + jobless growth = social stress
  - Urban informal sector squeezed by taxes and electricity costs
- **Private Sector Frustration**:
  - High interest rates = credit rationing
  - Delayed refunds, rising input costs, import bottlenecks
- **Provincial Disconnect**:
  - Low public investment in southern Punjab, Balochistan, ex-FATA

---

## Slide 6: The Case for Smart Public Investment

- **Strategic Areas**:
  - Human capital: schooling quality, malnutrition, skills
  - Connectivity: regional infrastructure, logistics, energy reforms
  - Green growth: local solar, water management, agri-modernisation
- **Pakistan's fiscal myth**:
  - Development is “luxury” spending?
  - Counterargument: it's the only path to inclusive resilience

---

## Slide 7: What Could Be Done Differently?

- **Smart fiscal loosening**:
  - Protect PSDP and social investment
  - Link expenditure to employment and outputs
- **Public-private hybrids**:
  - Encourage blended financing with risk guarantees
  - Green bond market, diaspora development funds
- **Better targeting, not broad austerity**:
  - Eliminate elite subsidies, protect productive ones
  - Leverage real-time data (NADRA, BISP) for targeting 
  - Leverage real-time data for electricity bills misused under 200 
  - SOEs loss making

## Political Economy of Prolonged Stabilisation

- **Why reforms stall**:
  - Short-term political costs
  - Centre-province fragmentation
  - Vested interests in energy, trade, land markets
- **Donor dynamics**:
  - “Do no harm” conditionalities → undercut reform ownership
  - Disconnected from federal-provincial realities

## International Lessons (Krugman Meets South Asia)

- **Egypt**: Cut too deep, growth stalled, social unrest rose.
- **Bangladesh**: Kept incentives for exports, protected health/education.
- **Ghana**: Debt reprofiling bought fiscal space, but stalled on delivery.
- **Lesson**: Macro targets ≠ structural recovery.

 *Krugman Meets South Asia*

> "Austerity in a depression is a trap — the more you cut, the weaker your economy becomes." — *Paul Krugman*

### 🏺 Egypt: Fiscal Orthodoxy, Social Dislocation
- Adopted strict IMF-backed austerity in 2016–2020.
- Subsidy cuts, currency devaluation, and rapid interest rate hikes.
- Result: Macro stability was achieved briefly — but **growth remained jobless**, **inflation soared**, and **street-level unrest intensified**.
- Lesson: Cutting too deep too fast **undermines political and social stability**, especially in economies with weak safety nets.

### 🧵 Bangladesh: Growth Through Pragmatic Sequencing
- Took a **calibrated approach** to stabilisation during 2008–2018.
- Maintained key **export incentives**, especially for garments sector.
- Continued **public investment in education, health**, and rural connectivity.
- Result: Growth sustained above 6% for over a decade, with **moderate inflation and stable FX reserves**.
- Lesson: **Targeted fiscal space** can support both macro goals and inclusive growth — if paired with sectoral focus and export dynamism.

### 💸 Ghana: Fiscal Room Gained, Momentum Lost
- Entered IMF program in 2015; implemented **debt reprofiling and fiscal consolidation**.
- Gained short-term breathing space, but failed to deliver **domestic reform** or **infrastructure ramp-up**.
- Political volatility and overreliance on commodity exports led to relapse into crisis by 2022.
- Lesson: **Fiscal space alone isn’t enough** — without follow-through on reform and delivery capacity, stabilisation unravels.

### 🧭 Cross-Country Takeaway for Pakistan
- **Macro targets ≠ structural recovery**.
- Fiscal restraint must be **sequenced with strategic investment** in growth drivers.
- What distinguishes success stories is not austerity, but **the ability to protect and prioritise public goods**, sustain employment, and **build domestic capacity** — even during tough reforms.

> **Pakistan must not confuse fiscal quiet with economic strength.**

## Reimagining Stabilisation

- **Can stabilisation be growth-positive?**
  - Yes, *if sequenced well* and *targets productivity*
- **Dual-track Strategy**:
  - Track 1: Fiscal discipline & FX management
  - Track 2: Public investment & social resilience
- **Role of data & analytics**:
  - Expenditure tracking, impact metrics, grievance redressal

---

## Slide 11: Concluding Reflections

- Stabilisation is necessary — *but not sufficient*
- Growth deferred is *justice deferred*
- Pakistan needs:
  - A fiscal strategy with a human face
  - A macro plan with a micro delivery model
  - A budget that invests in tomorrow, not just survives today

---

## Slide 12: Open Questions for Dialogue

- Can the next IMF program allow room for pro-growth spending?
- What political capital is needed to shift from cuts to smart investment?
- Can provincial governments become growth engines under tight ceilings?
