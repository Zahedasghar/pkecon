[A futuristic Industrial Policy](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2452503/a-futuristic-industrial-policy)

**National Industrial Policy 2023**

An Industrial Advisory Council has articulated its vision of an export-led industrial development to take Pakistan’s exports to \$100 billion within five years.

---

**Current Industrial Landscape**

An appraisal of Pakistan’s existing industrial architecture and its structural frailties: The current industrial structure has made Pakistan’s economy an outlier in a high-growth geographical region, despite being surrounded by fast-growing economies such as China and India.

-   **Structural Dysfunction**

Pakistan's imports of $55.3 billion were double its exports during FY 2022-23, with only a fraction of imports used as inputs for export-oriented production. This indicates a significant imbalance and highlights the structural dysfunction of Pakistan's industrial sector.
---

-   **Rationale for Industrial Policy**

Divergent Views : National industrial policy vs. market-led development. While some argue for market-led development, others point to successful examples like Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, which have used industrial policies effectively.

-   **4 Major Distortions in Pakistan's Industrial Structure**

-   

    1.  Anti-export bias

-   

    2.  Reliance on import substitution

-   

    3.  Market-seeking FDI

-   

    4.  Policy capture

These distortions hinder export-led growth and efficiency.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

## {.scrollable}
**Anti-Export Bias** 
- Pakistan’s industrial architecture exhibits an anti-export bias due to high import tariffs, incentivizing domestic industries to prioritize local sales over exports. 
Policies and incentives favor producing for the domestic market over exporting goods.

**Impact:** Makes exports less competitive because resources (like subsidies, cheaper credit, or tariff protections) are tilted toward local consumption instead of export-driven production.

Example: If a textile company makes more profit selling locally due to government incentives or high import duties on finished goods, it won’t be motivated to export — even if there's demand abroad. 

- For instance, a product priced at \$100 globally, after a 20% import tariff, is sold for \$120 domestically, discouraging exports. 

- This bias results in multiple damages:  

(a) Consumers pay higher prices domestically, 

(b) Domestic producers, shielded from competition, rely on captive domestic markets, and 

(c) Even if production costs are below \$100, exporters find it more profitable to sell domestically at \$120.  
- Thus, the anti-export bias hampers export competitiveness and perpetuates reliance on domestic markets.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Import Substitution**

What it means: Focus on producing goods domestically that were previously imported, often through protective policies like high tariffs.

Impact: Can create short-term industrial growth, but long-term it often leads to inefficiency, lack of competition, and poor quality products.

Example: Instead of encouraging innovation and exports, industries get comfortable making low-quality goods just for the local market because foreign competition is blocked. 

    -   Protected import substitution industries, being noncompetitive, contribute to the permanent burden on foreign exchange by relying on imported inputs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)**

Foreign companies invest in Pakistan mainly to sell to the local market, not to make it an export hub or part of a global supply chain. 


**Impact:** Limits technology transfer, innovation, and export potential. FDI doesn’t enhance industrial capabilities — it just serves local demand.

**Example:** A multinational car company setting up assembly plants just to sell cars in Pakistan, rather than making parts or vehicles for export.

---

**Policy Capture**

Industrial or political elites influence policy to benefit themselves — often at the expense of fair competition and public good. 


**Impact:** Leads to favoritism, rent-seeking, and inefficient allocation of resources. New or smaller players find it hard to enter markets.

Example: A big industrial group lobbying for favorable tax breaks or import restrictions, which hurt innovation and create monopolies.



------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Need for Radical Reforms** A forward-looking industrial policy needs to institute radical reforms at both the structural and enterprise levels. This includes transitioning from import substitution to export-led growth and creating an enabling environment for new firms.

-   **Future Industrial Policy** A futuristic industrial policy aims at creating a globally competitive industrial structure and rewarding efficiency and productivity over lobbying skills. It emphasizes the importance of self-sustaining industries and a gradual transition to an innovation-driven economy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Challenges and Goals** Developing an effective industrial policy faces challenges from vested interests and maneuvering of policy forums. The vital goal is to steer the transition towards an efficiency-driven export-led economy in the medium term and innovation-driven in the long term.

**Conclusion** Building a globally competitive industrial structure requires strategic reforms and a long-term vision. Despite challenges, the goal of achieving export-led growth and innovation-driven economy remains paramount for Pakistan's industrial development.
