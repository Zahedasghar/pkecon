## Context & Budget Overview

* Federal & provincial budgets for 2025–26 approved
* Optimism about fiscal targets: revenues, expenditures, and deficits
* Budgeted consolidated deficit: **Rs 6,501 billion** (3.9% of GDP) vs **Rs 7,444 billion** (5.6%) in 2024–25

## A Rare Achievement?

* Deficit below 4% of GDP for the **first time since 2003–04**
* Complies with **Fiscal Responsibility & Debt Limitation Act**
* Breakdown:

  * **Federal deficit:** 5.0% of GDP
  * **Provincial surplus:** 1.1% of GDP

## Growth vs. Reality

* **Quarterly GDP Growth:**

  * Q1 (Jul–Sep): -1.2% YoY
  * Q2 (Oct–Dec): -0.5% YoY
  * Q3 (Jan–Mar): -0.8% YoY
  * Q4 (Apr–Jun): Claimed +2.3% YoY (construction rebound)
* **Construction Activity:**

  * Negative growth in first three quarters
  * Claimed strong turnaround in Q4 (housing & infrastructure)
* **Household Income:** Average income per person has fallen over the last 3 years
* **Unemployment & Poverty:** Rising joblessness; poverty now affecting \~10.5 million people

## Target vs Reality – A Fragile Foundation

* Deficit target (3.9% of GDP) vs IMF projection (5.1% of GDP)
* Primary surplus targeted at 2.6% of GDP, IMF projects 1.6%
* Over-optimism driven by:

  * **Overestimated revenues**
  * **Understated expenditures**

## Revenue Ambitions

* FBR revenue target: **20.5%** growth vs \~13% GDP growth
* Implies 0.5% rise in tax-to-GDP ratio (after 1.4% jump in 2024–25)
* National tax-to-GDP ratio projected at **13%**

## Revenue Reality Check

* Normal revenue growth (\~12%) implies **Rs 1230B shortfall**
* Estimated gains from tax/admin measures: Rs 650B
* Net risk: **Rs 580B shortfall**

## Non-Tax Revenue Overstatements

* SBP profit projected at **Rs 2400B** (near last year’s peak)
* IMF expects **\~Rs 1000B** lower non-tax revenues
* **Petroleum levy** assumptions too optimistic (↑26% increase assumed)

## Total Revenue Risk

* Combined revenue shortfall risk: **Rs 1780B** (\~1.5% of GDP)

## Expenditure Targets – Seeming Restraint

* Federal current expenditure target: **Rs 16,286B** vs Rs 16,390B in 2024–25
* Despite hikes:

  * Salaries ↑10%
  * Pensions ↑7%
  * Defence ↑17%
  * BISP ↑20%

## Unrealistic Assumptions on Cuts

* **Debt servicing** projected to fall by Rs 740B

  * Despite debt rising by 8%
  * Assumes a large drop in interest rates (unlikely with high inflation and IMF conditions)
* **Subsidies** cut by Rs 192B

  * Most cuts in power sector; questionable due to structural inefficiencies

## Expenditure Slippage Risk

* Likely overspend: **Rs 900B** (\~0.7% of GDP)
* Combined with revenue shortfall, federal deficit could reach **\~7.2%** of GDP

## Provincial Budget Gaps

* Cash surplus target for provinces: **Rs 1464B**
* Punjab alone aims for Rs 963B surplus (Sindh budget shows a deficit)
* Federal shortfalls → lower transfers → \~Rs 500B risk to provincial surplus

## Summary of Risks

| Category               | Risk (Rs B) | % of GDP |
| :--------------------- | ----------: | -------: |
| Revenue shortfall      |        1780 |     1.5% |
| Expenditure overshoot  |         900 |     0.7% |
| Provincial surplus gap |         500 |     0.4% |
| **Total slippage**     |    **3180** | **2.6%** |

→ Actual deficit could approach **6.5%**, not **3.9%**.

## From Stabilisation to Fragility

* Official narrative: *“Stabilisation success.”*
* Reality: Growth sacrificed on weak fiscal assumptions
* IMF targets appear more realistic than optimistic budget targets

## Growth Implications

* Spending cuts and high interest rates = **no pro-growth stimulus**
* Revenue overreach → **higher tax burden**, dampening consumption & investment
* Missed opportunity to balance **growth** and fiscal reform

## Expert Critique & Policy Gaps

* Stability is largely driven by lower global oil and commodity prices (external factors), not domestic policy reforms *(Miftah Ismail)*
* No structural reforms implemented – pending **NFC Award** update, pension overhaul, and devolution commitments (18th Amendment) remain unaddressed
* Fiscal strategy leans on tax hikes instead of broadening the base; core expenditures (defence, pensions) continue to rise without significant reform

## The Way Forward

* **Revenue credibility:** Implement administrative reforms and set realistic targets
* **Expenditure discipline:** Contain non-productive expenditures (e.g. losses, untargeted subsidies)
* **Rebalance priorities:** Invest more in development & human capital for growth
* **Realism with IMF:** Maintain a credible, realistic engagement with IMF targets

## Closing Thought

> “Budgets built on fragile foundations can neither stabilise the economy nor promote inclusive growth.”
