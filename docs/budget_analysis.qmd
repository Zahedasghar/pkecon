## The Central Question {.center}

 *"Stabilization without growth is treating symptoms while the disease progresses."*

### **Three Critical Questions**
::: {.fragment}
**What is Pakistan stabilising *from*?**
- Twin deficits, debt stress, inflation spiral
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Who bears the cost of prolonged stabilisation?**
- Youth, SMEs, informal workers, provinces
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Can we afford to delay growth?**
- Lost decade vs. managed transition
:::

::: notes
**Opening Framework:**
- We're witnessing a classic macroeconomic policy dilemma: the tension between immediate stabilization needs and longer-term growth imperatives
- Pakistan has achieved remarkable macroeconomic stabilization in 2025, but the question remains: at what cost and for how long?
- Today's presentation challenges the conventional wisdom that stabilization must precede growth, arguing instead for a more nuanced, sequential approach

**Key Context:**
- Pakistan entered 2024 with inflation above 29%, current account deficits, and debt sustainability concerns
- By mid-2025, inflation has dropped to 3.2%, current account is in surplus, but growth remains anemic at 2.6%
- This presents a policy crossroads: continue with orthodox stabilization or pivot toward growth-oriented policies

::: notes
**Key Insights from the Data:**
1. **Inflation Success Story**: From 29.2% in 2024 to 3.2% in 2025 - one of the most dramatic inflation reductions globally
2. **Growth Challenge**: Despite stabilization, growth remains below Pakistan's potential (5-6% needed for demographic dividend)
3. **Fiscal Improvement**: Primary surplus achieved, but still running overall deficit
4. **Employment Concerns**: Unemployment stubbornly high, particularly affecting youth (not fully captured in official statistics due to informal sector)

**Policy Implications:**
- Pakistan has proven it can achieve stabilization quickly when political will exists
- The question now: can this stabilization platform be leveraged for sustainable growth?
- Risk of stabilization becoming a permanent state rather than a transition phase

## The Budget's Message 
- **What it emphasizes**: IMF targets, fiscal discipline, debt management
- **What it marginalizes**: Development investment, job creation, productivity enhancement
- **What it reveals**: A budget for survival, not transformation

::: notes
**Budget Analysis Deep Dive:**
- **Debt Servicing Dominance**: 45.8% of budget goes to debt servicing - the highest in Pakistan's history
- **Development Squeeze**: PSDP allocation dropped from 8.1% to 6.8% - exactly when Pakistan needs counter-cyclical investment
- **Structural Implications**: This allocation pattern locks Pakistan into a low-growth equilibrium

**Critical Questions for Audience:**
1. Is this resource allocation sustainable for a country with Pakistan's demographic profile?
2. What does it signal to private investors about the state's commitment to growth?
3. How long can we maintain macroeconomic stability without addressing structural bottlenecks?

**International Context**: 
- Compare with successful emerging economies: typically allocate 15-20% to development during transformation phases
- Pakistan's current allocation resembles crisis management rather than growth strategy

## Keneth Rogoff with Cowen on Pakistan Debt Crisis {.center} 

### Pakistan's Unique IMF Relationship
  
- **Never been out of an IMF program** in 75 years
- Currently on the **25th IMF program** since independence
- **Only country** that has never made independent economic policy

### The Geopolitical Reality

 **Kenneth Rogoff:** "Pakistan is geopolitically very important... If you don't sign off on bailout number 25, they're going to default on bailout number 24"

--- 

## Tax System & FBR Crisis


![FBR](albatross.png){.stretch}

- Single-handedly shrunk formal sector over 15-20 years 
- SUPER tax : Dont grow 

- Excessive discretionary powers scaring genuine investors 
- Boosted informal economy which doesn't contribute to productivity, revenues, or FDI

---

## Tax Policy Contradictions

Corporate tax rates too high (should be halved) 

Agriculture, Services, and Real Estate sectors under-taxed while all burden shared by Industrial sector and formal sector 

NFC?? 

Last 3 years: collected more taxes than previous 14 years combined

# The Primary Surplus Trap: When Math Meets Reality

## Pakistan's Debt Sustainability Crisis

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
### The Numbers Don't Add Up
- **Real GDP Growth:** 3%
- **Real Interest Rate:** 7% 
- **Required Primary Surplus:** 2.3% of GDP annually
- **Gap to Bridge:** 4% per year through austerity

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### What is Primary Surplus?
::: {.callout-note}
**Primary Surplus** = Government Revenue - Government Spending  
*(excluding debt service payments)*

The money left over before paying interest on existing debt
:::
:::

:::

**Key Insight:** When real interest rates (7%) exceed growth rates (3%), debt-to-GDP ratio deteriorates by 4% annually unless offset by fiscal surplus

## The Krugman Insight: When Austerity Becomes a Trap {.center}

 *"Austerity in a depression is a trap — the more you cut, the weaker your economy becomes."* — Paul Krugman

**Traditional Logic:** 

- Cut spending → Reduce deficit 

- Lower deficit → Restore confidence 

- Higher confidence → Private investment 

- More investment → Growth returns

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Reality Check:** 

- Cut spending → Reduce demand 

- Lower demand → Business contraction 

- Less business → Lower tax revenue 

- Revenue shortfall → More cuts needed

:::
::: 


::: notes
**Krugman's Core Argument:**
- During economic downturns, government spending cuts worsen recession rather than improve fiscal position
- The multiplier effect works in reverse: each dollar cut from spending reduces GDP by more than one dollar
- This creates a vicious cycle where austerity undermines the economic base needed for fiscal recovery

**Pakistan-Specific Application:**
1. **Timing Matters**: Pakistan implemented austerity when private sector was already weak
2. **Capacity Constraints**: Limited private sector ability to fill the investment gap left by public sector cuts
3. **Social Costs**: Youth unemployment and informal sector stress create political economy pressures

**Counter-Arguments to Address:**
- "But Pakistan had no choice due to debt crisis" → True, but sequencing and composition of cuts matter
- "Private sector will fill the gap" → Requires examining Pakistan's private investment trends and constraints
- "Stabilization first, growth later" → Question the sustainability of this sequencing in Pakistan's context

**🇧🇩 Bangladesh: Pragmatic Sequencing**
- Kept export incentives during stabilization
- Protected social spending (health, education)
- Result: 6%+ growth for over a decade

**🇪🇬 Egypt: Austerity Trap**
- Deep cuts, rapid currency adjustment
- Achieved macro stability but jobless growth
- Social unrest forced policy reversal
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**🇹🇷 Turkey: Stop-Go Cycles**
- Repeatedly chose short-term growth over stability
- Result: Chronic inflation, currency crises
- Lesson: Discipline matters, but so does sequencing

**🇱🇰 Sri Lanka: Late Adjustment**
- Delayed necessary reforms
- Crisis became unavoidable
- Extreme austerity with severe social costs
:::
:::

::: notes
**Comparative Analysis Framework:**
- **Bangladesh's Success**: Maintained sectoral focus (RMG), gradual liberalization, protected human capital investment
- **Egypt's Mixed Results**: Achieved macroeconomic stabilization but failed to generate inclusive growth
- **Turkey's Volatility**: Shows the dangers of populist macroeconomic policy but also excessive orthodoxy
- **Sri Lanka's Crisis**: Demonstrates the costs of delayed adjustment but also the risks of shock therapy

**Key Lessons for Pakistan:**
1. **Sequencing Matters**: Successful countries protected growth-enhancing expenditures during stabilization
2. **Sectoral Strategy**: Bangladesh's focus on textiles, Vietnam's manufacturing - what is Pakistan's comparative advantage?
3. **Social Contract**: Countries that maintained minimum social provisions had more sustainable reforms
4. **Time Horizon**: Quick stabilization is possible, but structural transformation takes 5-10 years

**Critical Question**: Which model is Pakistan following, and is it the right one for its circumstances?

### **Key Insight: Multipliers Matter More in Recessions** {.fragment}
When private demand is weak, each rupee of public investment has outsized impact

::: notes
**Multiplier Economics Explained:**
- **Short-term multipliers** capture immediate demand effects (construction jobs, materials purchase)
- **Long-term multipliers** include productivity and capacity effects (better roads improve competitiveness)
- **Pakistan context**: High unemployment means larger multipliers for employment-intensive sectors

**Policy Implications:**
1. **Not all cuts are equal**: Cutting infrastructure investment costs more than cutting subsidies
2. **Timing matters**: Multipliers are larger during downturns when resources are idle
3. **Composition strategy**: Smart fiscal consolidation focuses on low-multiplier items first

**Research Note**: These multipliers are estimated based on Pakistan-specific studies and IMF research on emerging economies. The key insight is that Pakistan's current budget prioritizes items with low multipliers (debt servicing, defense) over high-multiplier investments (infrastructure, education).

**Question for Reflection**: If public investment multipliers are 2.1 in the long term, what does this say about the opportunity cost of current budget allocations?

### **The Distributional Question** {.fragment}
Who pays for stabilization, and who benefits from it?

::: notes
**Social Impact Analysis:**
- **Urban Youth**: Highest impact due to limited job creation, expensive education, delayed economic opportunities
- **Rural Poor**: Affected by reduced agricultural support, higher input costs, limited access to credit
- **SME Owners**: Credit rationing, high interest rates, reduced demand for goods/services
- **Regional Disparities**: Notice how development budget allocation doesn't correlate with poverty rates

**Ethical Dimensions:**
1. **Intergenerational Equity**: Are we asking today's youth to pay for past fiscal mistakes?
2. **Regional Justice**: Do stabilization policies worsen existing inequalities?
3. **Class Implications**: Do burden-sharing arrangements reflect ability to pay?

**Policy Questions:**
- Can Pakistan design stabilization policies that protect the most vulnerable?
- What social protection mechanisms are compatible with fiscal discipline?
- How can development spending be targeted to reduce rather than increase inequality?

**International Evidence**: Countries with more equitable stabilization programs tend to have more sustainable reforms and better long-term growth outcomes.

### **The Dual-Track Approach** {.fragment}
- **Track 1**: Maintain macro discipline (fiscal, monetary, debt)  
- **Track 2**: Strategic investments in growth foundations  
- **Key**: Sequenced implementation, not either-or choice

::: notes
**Conceptual Framework:**
- **False Dichotomy**: The choice between stabilization and growth is often overstated
- **Composition Matters**: How you stabilize matters as much as whether you stabilize
- **Sequencing Strategy**: Gradual shift from stabilization-heavy to growth-heavy policy mix

**Dual-Track Implementation:**
1. **Stabilization Track** (Years 1-2): Achieve macro targets but protect high-multiplier spending
2. **Transition Phase** (Years 3-4): Gradually increase growth-oriented investments
3. **Growth Track** (Years 5-6): Full focus on structural transformation

**Critical Success Factors:**
- **Political Commitment**: Long-term perspective beyond electoral cycles
- **Institutional Capacity**: Ability to implement complex, coordinated policies
- **Social Buy-in**: Maintaining public support through visible improvements
- **External Support**: International partner backing for this approach

**Risk Management**: Each track has built-in safeguards to prevent backsliding on either stabilization or growth objectives.

::: notes
**Investment Strategy Rationale:**
- **High Impact, Low Cost**: Digital infrastructure and education technology offer quick wins
- **Strategic Patience**: Transport and water management require longer timeframes but essential for transformation
- **Employment Focus**: Job creation numbers reflect both direct and indirect employment effects

**Financing Strategy:**
1. **Phase 1** (Immediate): Use existing fiscal space, international climate financing
2. **Phase 2** (Medium-term): Blend domestic savings mobilization with FDI
3. **Phase 3** (Long-term): Leverage improved credit rating for infrastructure bonds

**Implementation Considerations:**
- **Capacity Building**: Many of these investments require institutional development
- **Technology Transfer**: Partnerships with leading countries in each sector
- **Regional Integration**: Coordinate investments with CPEC and regional connectivity

**Monitoring and Evaluation**: Each investment category needs clear KPIs and regular assessment to ensure optimal resource utilization.

**Risk Analysis Framework:**
- **High Probability, High Impact**: Climate events and external shocks require immediate attention
- **High Impact, Lower Probability**: Debt sustainability and political instability need contingency planning
- **Current Gaps**: Pakistan's mitigation capacity is weakest for climate events and political risks

**Specific Risk Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **External Shocks**: 
   - Diversify trade partners and export products
   - Build foreign exchange reserves to 4+ months of imports
   - Develop flexible exchange rate mechanisms

2. **Climate Events**: 
   - Invest in climate-resilient infrastructure
   - Develop early warning systems
   - Create climate adaptation financing mechanisms

3. **Political Instability**: 
   - Build broad-based consensus on economic reforms
   - Strengthen democratic institutions
   - Improve federal-provincial coordination

**Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Investment in risk mitigation typically pays for itself within 3-5 years through avoided crisis costs.

**Philosophical Shift Required:**
- Move from crisis management to strategic planning
- Shift from elite-focused to mass-based economic policy
- Transform from extractive to productive economic institutions

**Elements of New Social Contract:**
1. **Economic Democracy**: Broader participation in economic opportunities
2. **Social Protection**: Universal basic services while maintaining work incentives
3. **Environmental Justice**: Sustainable development that protects future generations
4. **Regional Equity**: Development strategies that reduce geographical disparities

**Implementation Challenges:**
- **Political Economy**: Overcoming vested interests that benefit from current arrangements
- **Institutional Capacity**: Building state capacity to deliver on new commitments
- **Resource Constraints**: Financing expanded social contract within fiscal discipline

**International Examples**: 
- South Korea's developmental state model
- Brazil's conditional cash transfer programs

## Conclusions: Growth Cannot Remain on Hold Forever {.center}

### **Key Insights from Today's Analysis**

::: {.fragment}
**✓ Government has failed to come up with a budget which talks beyond survival**
- With Inflation controlled, current account balanced, fiscal discipline restored, budget does not talk about growth 

:::

::: {.fragment}
**⚠️ Stabilization without growth is unsustainable**
- Social costs mount, productivity stagnates, political pressures build
:::

::: {.fragment}
**🎯 Smart sequencing, not either-or choices** 

- Dual-track approach balancing macro stability with strategic investment is missing altogether
:::

::: {.fragment}
**💡 Success requires redefining the economic development model**
- From crisis management to strategic transformation 

- From being *COSMOPOLITAN* to being *PEOPLE-CENTRIC* 

:::

## **The Bottom Line** {.fragment}

 *Pakistan stands at a crossroads. It can continue on the path of perpetual stabilization, achieving fiscal targets while the economy stagnates. Or it can leverage its hard-won stability to launch a new phase of inclusive, sustainable growth. The choice will define the next decade.* 
 
### Number 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of economic development is *"GROWTH"* and not *STABILIZATION*. For this one has to invest in people, invest in infrastructure, invest in education, invest in health, invest in social safety nets. 
 


::: notes
**Synthesis of Arguments:**
1. **Stabilization Achievement**: Pakistan has successfully navigated immediate crisis - this is not disputed
2. **Cost Analysis**: But prolonged stabilization creates its own risks and costs
3. **Alternative Framework**: Dual-track approach offers a way forward without sacrificing macro stability
4. **Implementation Reality**: Success requires political will, institutional capacity, and social patience

**Call to Action for Policymakers:**
- **Short-term**: Begin rebalancing budget priorities within existing fiscal envelope
- **Medium-term**: Develop institutional mechanisms for coordinated growth strategy
- **Long-term**: Build political consensus for sustained reform program

**For the Academic Community:**
- Research priorities: fiscal multipliers in Pakistani context, optimal sequencing of reforms, social impact assessment of stabilization policies
- Policy engagement: Bridge gap between academic research and policy implementation
- International collaboration: Learn from successful transformation experiences

**Final Reflection**: The title question "Growth on Hold?" should be answered definitively: Yes, growth has been on hold, but it doesn't have to remain so. Pakistan has the tools, knowledge, and opportunity to move beyond stabilization toward transformation.

## Discussion Questions {.center}

### **For Reflection and Debate**

1. **Political Economy**: What political incentives keep Pakistan in prolonged stabilization mode, and how can they be changed?

2. **International Relations**: Can Pakistan negotiate more growth-friendly conditionalities with international financial institutions?

3. **Federal Structure**: How can provincial governments become growth engines while maintaining fiscal discipline?

4. **Private Sector**: What role should the private sector play in Pakistan's transformation, and what support does it need?

5. **Timeline**: Is a 6-year transformation timeline realistic, or should Pakistan think in terms of decades?

::: notes
**Facilitating Discussion:**
These questions are designed to probe deeper into the practical and political dimensions of the analysis presented. Encourage participants to:

1. **Challenge Assumptions**: What if the analysis is wrong about multipliers or sequencing?
2. **Consider Constraints**: What real-world factors make the recommendations difficult to implement?
3. **Explore Alternatives**: Are there other models Pakistan should consider?
4. **Think Long-term**: What are the implications of today's choices for the next generation?

**Potential Follow-up Research:**
- Detailed fiscal space analysis for specific investment priorities
- Provincial-level impact assessment of different policy scenarios
- Comparative study of successful economic transformations in similar contexts
- Social impact modeling of alternative stabilization approaches

**Policy Engagement Opportunities:**
- Present findings to federal and provincial government officials
- Engage with private sector associations and civil society organizations
- Collaborate with international development partners on implementation strategies
- Contribute to public debate through media and policy forums
