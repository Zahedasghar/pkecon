### Introduction 

- Focus: Performance of Pakistan in growth areas 

    - Productivity 
    
    - Growth of firms and investment 
    
    - Female labor force participation 
    
- Objective: Address distortions affecting growth and propose reforms

---

### Slide 3: Productivity Dynamics 

- Decline in aggregate productivity over the past decade 
- 23% contraction in firms' productivity due to COVID-19 
- Stronger contractions in family-owned firms 
- Agriculture: 
    - Yields growth due to input use 
    - Falling total factor productivity with provincial variations

---

### Allocative Efficiency Gains 

- Modest allocative efficiency gains observed 

- Systematic losses in agriculture in Punjab 

- Eliminating distortions can lead to 30% productivity gains

---

## Export Productivity Premium 

- Significant productivity premium for exporters 

- Declining share of exporting firms and exports 

- Duty Drawback of Taxes (DDT) impact: Small positive impact and high cost/benefit ratio

---

### Import Duties Impact 

- High import duties on intermediates affect productivity, sales, and wages 

- All manufacturing sectors experienced increased duties 
- Negative effects largest for small exporters

---

### Climate Change and Agriculture 

- Climate change threatens agricultural productivity 

- Crops negatively affected by higher temperatures and rainfall variations 

- Importance of investing in adaptation technologies

---

### Private Investment and FDI 

- Decline in productivity linked to low investment rates 
- FDI remained below 1% of GDP 

- Limited growth of firms due to size-dependent policies and crowding out by government borrowing 


---

### Insider-Outsider Dynamics 

- Powerful 'insiders' influencing policies 

- Distortions at the expense of outsiders and growth 

- Reforms require strong political leadership and civil society

## FLFPR {.scorllable} 

> When it is said there is more females in labour force , will it not lead to less opportunities for male in a developing country where opportunities are already limited

## Not really—labour‑market opportunities are not a fixed pie

When women take paid jobs, three things usually happen that offset (and often exceed) any direct “competition” with men.

---

## Mechanism 1: Demand Expands

**How it works**  
Women’s earnings raise household spending and savings, which feeds back into higher demand for goods and services and therefore more hiring. Firms also invest when a larger, more skilled workforce becomes available.

**Evidence**  
An IMF cross‑country study finds that narrowing the female‑male participation gap by 6 percentage points could lift GDP by about 8% within a few years.

---

## Mechanism 2: Jobs Created Upstream & Downstream

**How it works**  
New female‑intensive industries pull in male workers in transport, logistics, sales, and management. Complementary skills matter more than substitutes.

**Evidence**  
Sectoral studies (VoxDev) show female factory growth rarely depresses male employment. Instead, it shifts men into higher-skill roles and raises household income.

---

## Mechanism 3: Productivity Gains

**How it works**  
Diverse teams innovate more. A broader talent pool lets firms match people to tasks better, raising total factor productivity.

**Evidence**  
IZA data shows that each 1% rise in women’s employment links to a 0.3-0.4% rise in labour productivity in developing countries.

---

## But Aren’t Jobs Already Scarce?

Scarcity often reflects too little labour demand and productivity.  
Policies promoting women’s work—childcare, transport, anti-discrimination, skills—also raise productivity and attract investment.

**Examples**  
Rwanda, Vietnam, and the Philippines have seen male employment ratios stay stable while GDP and total employment grew.

---

## Possible Short-Run Frictions

**Sectoral crowding-out**  
- Temporary male wage dips in easily substitutable jobs.
- Solution: Reskilling and mobility support.

**Social norms**  
- Stigma may slow male entry into "female" sectors.
- Solution: Norm shifts over time.

---

## What Should Policymakers Do?

- **Grow the pie**: Promote manufacturing, services, and digital entrepreneurship.
- **Equalize human-capital investment**: Remove tuition and STEM barriers.
- **Support care infrastructure**: Child and elder care frees time and creates jobs.
- **Tackle discrimination and informality**: Enforce equal-pay laws and ease business registration.

---

## Bottom Line

More women in the workforce **increases** the total pool of decent jobs.  
It raises productivity, expands markets, and stimulates investment that benefits everyone.




### Female Labor Force Participation 

- Pakistan's lower-than-average FLFP 

- Misallocation of female talent 

- GDP gains of 5-23% by closing the female employment gap

---

## Proposed Reforms 

- Remove distortions to improve aggregate productivity 

    - Tax policy, Trade policy, Export schemes, Size-dependent policies, Agriculture subsidies, Working conditions for women 
    
- Complementary reforms for positive impact 

    - Fiscal space, Credit, Managerial practices, Business climate, Investment framework, Insolvency regime

---

### Policy Implementation 

- Implement reforms sequentially 

- Engage academia for evidence-based policymaking 

- Ensure transparency and public scrutiny

---

### Conclusion 

- Importance of addressing distortions for growth 

- Global challenges post-COVID-19 and Ukraine war 

- Need for strong political will and civil society involvement
