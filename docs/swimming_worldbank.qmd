    - Productivity 
    
    - Growth of firms and investment 
    
    - Female labor force participation 
    
- Objective: Address distortions affecting growth and propose reforms

---

### Slide 3: Productivity Dynamics 

- Decline in aggregate productivity over the past decade 
- 23% contraction in firms' productivity due to COVID-19 
- Stronger contractions in family-owned firms 
- Agriculture: 
    - Yields growth due to input use 
    - Falling total factor productivity with provincial variations

---

### Allocative Efficiency Gains 

- Modest allocative efficiency gains observed 

- Systematic losses in agriculture in Punjab 

- Eliminating distortions can lead to 30% productivity gains

---

## Export Productivity Premium 

- Significant productivity premium for exporters 

- Declining share of exporting firms and exports 

- Duty Drawback of Taxes (DDT) impact: Small positive impact and high cost/benefit ratio

---

### Import Duties Impact 

- High import duties on intermediates affect productivity, sales, and wages 

- All manufacturing sectors experienced increased duties 
- Negative effects largest for small exporters

---

### Climate Change and Agriculture 

- Climate change threatens agricultural productivity 

- Crops negatively affected by higher temperatures and rainfall variations 

- Importance of investing in adaptation technologies

---

### Private Investment and FDI 

- Decline in productivity linked to low investment rates 
- FDI remained below 1% of GDP 

- Limited growth of firms due to size-dependent policies and crowding out by government borrowing 


---

### Insider-Outsider Dynamics 

- Powerful 'insiders' influencing policies 

- Distortions at the expense of outsiders and growth 

- Reforms require strong political leadership and civil society

---

### Female Labor Force Participation 

- Pakistan's lower-than-average FLFP 

- Misallocation of female talent 

- GDP gains of 5-23% by closing the female employment gap

---

## Proposed Reforms 

- Remove distortions to improve aggregate productivity 

    - Tax policy, Trade policy, Export schemes, Size-dependent policies, Agriculture subsidies, Working conditions for women 
    
- Complementary reforms for positive impact 

    - Fiscal space, Credit, Managerial practices, Business climate, Investment framework, Insolvency regime

---

### Policy Implementation 

- Implement reforms sequentially 

- Engage academia for evidence-based policymaking 

- Ensure transparency and public scrutiny

---

### Conclusion 

- Importance of addressing distortions for growth 

- Global challenges post-COVID-19 and Ukraine war 

- Need for strong political will and civil society involvement
