Speaker Notes Livestock plays a crucial role in Pakistan's agricultural sector, contributing significantly to the economy and livelihoods. This slide deck will explore the importance of livestock, highlighting various aspects like production, contribution to food security, and challenges faced by the sector. By understanding the significance of livestock, we can develop strategies for its sustainable growth and development.
:::

## Livestock Production in Pakistan

-   Diverse range of livestock species: Cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, poultry
-   Significant contribution to GDP: Approximately 11.6% (2023 estimate)
-   Provides livelihood for millions: Farmers, herders, dairy workers, etc.
-   Source of essential food products: Meat, milk, eggs

::: notes
Pakistan boasts a diverse range of livestock species, including cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, and poultry. This sector significantly contributes to the national GDP, estimated to be around 11.6% in 2023. Livestock provides essential food products like meat, milk, and eggs, ensuring food security for the population. The sector also serves as a vital source of income and livelihood for millions of farmers, herders, dairy workers, and others involved in the production and marketing chain.
:::

## Importance of Livestock: Beyond Food Security

-   Source of income and employment generation
-   Provides raw materials for industries: Leather, wool, etc.
-   Manure used as organic fertilizer: Improves soil fertility
-   Draft power for agricultural activities: Plowing, transportation

::: notes
The importance of livestock extends beyond food security. It serves as a crucial source of income and employment generation for millions of people in rural areas. The hides and skins of animals are used in the leather industry, while wool finds application in textile production. Livestock manure serves as a valuable organic fertilizer, improving soil fertility and crop yields. Additionally, draft animals like oxen are used for plowing fields and transporting goods in rural areas, contributing to agricultural activities.
:::

## Challenges in the Livestock Sector

![](images/agri4.png){.center width="438"}

-   Feed and water scarcity: Impacts animal health and productivity

-   Inadequate disease control measures: Increases livestock mortality

-   Traditional farming practices: Limits efficiency and productivity

-   Lack of access to veterinary services: Limits disease prevention and treatment Marketing inefficiencies: Low returns for farmers

::: notes
Despite its importance, the livestock sector faces several challenges that hinder its growth potential. Feed and water scarcity, particularly in arid regions, impacts animal health and productivity. Inadequate disease control measures can lead to outbreaks, causing significant livestock mortality. Traditional farming practices often lack efficiency and productivity compared to modern methods. Limited access to veterinary services in rural areas hinders disease prevention and treatment. Additionally, marketing inefficiencies lead to low returns for farmers, discouraging investment in the sector.
:::

## Enhancing Livestock Production: The Way Forward

-   Investment in feed and water security: Improved infrastructure and management

-   Strengthening disease control programs: Vaccination drives, veterinary services

-   Promoting modern farming practices: Introduction of new technologies

-   Expanding access to veterinary services: Outreach programs in rural areas

-   Development of efficient marketing channels: Connecting farmers with fair markets

::: notes
Addressing the challenges faced by the livestock sector is crucial for its sustainable growth and development. Investments in feed and water security through improved infrastructure and management practices are essential. Strengthening disease control programs with vaccination drives and expanded veterinary services can significantly reduce livestock mortality. Promoting modern farming practices that leverage new technologies can enhance productivity and efficiency. Expanding access to veterinary services, particularly in rural areas through outreach programs, can ensure timely diagnosis and treatment of animal diseases. Finally, developing efficient marketing channels that connect farmers with fair markets can improve their returns, incentivizing investment in the sector.

## Absentee Landlordism and Taxation {.scrollable}

The critique of absentee landlordism refers to the examination and criticism of the phenomenon where individuals or entities own agricultural land but do not actively participate in its cultivation or management. Here are some key points of critique:

1.  **Resource Misallocation**: Absentee landlords often prioritize profit over sustainable land management or community welfare. This can lead to misallocation of resources and neglect of the land's long-term productivity.

2.  **Wealth Concentration**: Absentee landlords may accumulate large tracts of land, concentrating wealth and power in the hands of a few individuals or entities. This can exacerbate social and economic inequality within rural communities.

3.  **Negative Impact on Rural Development**: Absentee ownership can hinder local economic development by limiting opportunities for local farmers and businesses. It may also result in reduced investment in infrastructure and services in rural areas.

4.  **Land Tenure Issues**: Absentee landlords may lease land to tenant farmers under exploitative or unfair terms, leading to land tenure insecurity and perpetuating poverty among rural populations.

5.  **Environmental Concerns**: Absentee landlords may prioritize short-term profit over environmental conservation, leading to unsustainable land use practices, deforestation, soil degradation, and other environmental harms.

6.  **Lack of Accountability**: Absentee landlords may not be directly affected by the consequences of their land management decisions, leading to a lack of accountability for negative social, economic, and environmental impacts.

Critiques of absentee landlordism often advocate for policies and interventions that promote equitable land distribution, empower local farmers, and encourage responsible land stewardship for sustainable rural development.

        -   **Payouts take 8-10 months**
    -   **Parametric Insurance**:
        -   **Successful pilots in Pakistan**
        -   **Payouts during crop lifecycle**
        -   **Who will pay for insurance?**

## Soil Testing

-   **Slow process**
-   **Farmers do not practice it**
-   **Takes several days** for results
-   **Without soil analysis**, suboptimal fertilizer use → **poor soil health**
-   **Variation in results** – 80%

### Innovation & Future Outlook

-   **MIT collaboration**: Developing a **low-cost real-time soil testing kit**
-   **Planned pilot in Pakistan this year**
