## [Kawasakinomics]{.flow}

-   Bottom up approach

-   Tough competition : explore the unexplored

-   Continuous upgrade : products can be imitated as Korea, China and many others have imitated Japan. e.g Korea in electronic industry

-   Not natural resource but highly trained human capital is main factor for strong industrial base

-   Industrial development is basically a Talent war : Japan, Singapore, Israel

## Implicit in the oft-repeated Japanese statement,

> “We are an island nation with no natural resources,”

is the understanding that these deficiencies have only served to spur Japan’s competitive innovation.

Strong industrial base must be backed by the strength of the institutions, high quality human capital

## Domestic demand

[A nation’s companies gain competitive advantage if domestic buyers are the world’s most sophisticated and demanding buyers for the product or service. Sophisticated, demanding buyers provide a window into advanced customer needs; they pressure companies to meet high standards; they prod them to improve, to innovate, and to upgrade into more advanced segments. As with factor conditions, demand conditions provide advantages by forcing companies to respond to tough challenges.](https://hbr.org/1990/03/the-competitive-advantage-of-nations) - e.g Japanese pioneered compact, quiet air-conditioning units powered by energy-saving rotary compressors

## Local intense Rivalary is key

![Japanese firms: most intense domestic competion](images/japan_rivalary.png){.r-stretch}

## Pakistan case

Pakistani firms are uncompetitive, although heavily subsidized and protected by the government. In many of the prominent industries in which there is hardly any competition, and government has played a large role in distorting competition.

## Policy consistency alone not enough

Pakistan’s auto industry is an obvious example of the failure of import substitution policies.\
- Auto industry has been protected for the last 40 years, but it has not been able to achieve economies of scale, and the cost of production is still high.

-   First five-year auto development policy 2002: focused on achieving higher localization of cars through deletion programs and increasing the volume of local production to at least 500,000, aiming to achieve economies of scale.

-   Currently fourth auto development policy and despite the consistency of policies (high protection and localization), we are far from achieving these aims, as they were in many ways contradictory.

-   Pakistan has not been able to export a single car, and its auto-part exports at \$15 million are not even one 0.3 per cent that of Turkey.

## What is wrong

-   Pakistan economy crashes every once in a while: feature by design
    -   Very low investment rate
    -   Fiscal problem: For every USD govt raises in revenue, it has to spend 2.7 USD Income 1000 USD, spending 2700 USD
    -   Sins: Income and pensions
    -   If no borrowing, country to shut down
-   Balance of Payment: X=1000, M=2750 USD

> High Import taxes in the name of import substitution doing more damage than good

## Why Export Matters

-   global competitiveness

-   Capacity to innovate and compete with the rest of the world

-   1992: Indian export increased 13 times while Pak only doubles

-   Vietnam : 15 B USD in 2001 and 220 B USD in 2018

-   Export per capital India increased by 6.8 times while BD by 6.2 as compared to Pakistan

    -   Uncompetitiveness as compared to neighboring countries

-   Export : dynamism, technology absorption and adaptation, building reputation, brand names

-   Sports, textile, surgical: no branding

-   Reasons: Mangerial skills, organizational skills, skills, skills...

## Complexity vs Complicated

Aggregate productivity stagnant or declining : Farms/firms becoming less productive over time

-   Productivity decline in firms specially in family-owned

-   Yield has grown but due to intensive use of inputs

-   On the import side: high duties negatively affected firms' productivity as well as sales and wages

-   Import duties from 15% in FY10 to 21.3% in FY20 implying higher cost of importing intermediaries and capital equipment

> Producitivity is key in all economic sectors from the point of view of employment, poverty reduction and export orientation

## Flawed Economic Discourse

Pipedreams: SEZs, Roads, Corridors, Gas pipelines

Stuck: hardcore paradigm of development where as

Reality: Software is primary requirement and has symbiotic relationship with hardcore infrastructure

## Boosting Domestic Productivity

-   Boosting domestic productivity which means raising the capacities and capabilities of your people

-   Import taxes to protect domestic industry leading to no improvement in domestic capacity

> One needs hard work, local thinking, building teams, build institutions and throwing industry to tough competition by shedding protention diapers

## Challenges

-   Global market saturated with goods and services

-   Challenges for Industrial Development in Digital Era

## Software : Cant be exported

-   Rule of Law (Contracts are honored)

-   Development and Allocation of Talent

-   Organisational and managerial capacity

-   Knowledge acquisition

-   Stuck in MH paradigm

> All this : Cant be bought, domestic capacity and domestic reforms One has to built all this as it can not be imported . Broad conceptual parameters - Education, Health investment for better inputs - Boosting domestic productivity
