## Opening Context

-   Pakistan has entered 25 IMF programs since 1988
-   IMF focus has always been **stabilization**:
    -   Monetary tightening
    -   Fiscal austerity
    -   Utility price hikes
    -   Market-based exchange rate
-   Yet, economic crises repeat â€” why?

---

## The Stabilization Trap

-   Tools used repeatedly:
    -   High interest rates
    -   Cuts to subsidies
    -   Currency devaluation
-   Consequences:
    -   Investment collapse
    -   Jobless recovery
    -   Development spending squeezed

---

## What Stabilization Achieves

-   Inflation control (short-term)
-   FX reserve buildup
-   Signals to donors and IFIs
-   BUT:
    -   Temporary
    -   Lacks sustainable growth impact

---

## The Missing Ingredient â€” Growth

-   Without growth:
    -   No revenue expansion
    -   No employment generation
    -   No fiscal room for defense, education, health
-   Youth bulge = risk if opportunities donâ€™t grow

---

## What Growth Requires

1.  **Human Capital**
    -   Education, health, skills
2.  **Business Climate Reforms**
    -   Reduce red tape, enforce contracts
3.  **Export Diversification**
    -   Beyond textiles: IT, value-added agri, manufacturing
4.  **Infrastructure**
    -   Energy, transport, connectivity
5.  **Credit Access**
    -   Support for SMEs and startups

## High Taxes Impact

## IMF: Need for a New Lens

- Stabilization must **enable**, not strangle growth
- IMF conditionalities should:
  - Incentivize investment
  - Avoid pro-cyclical cuts
  - Support productivity reforms
---

## Sectoral Impact

-   **Defense**: Needs long-term fiscal space
-   **Education & Health**: Get cut during austerity
-   **Youth**: Face rising unemployment
-   **Women**: Bear cost of inflation, services withdrawal

---

## A Path Forward

-   National consensus on long-term economic strategy
-   Push for IMF programs with:
    -   Growth-linked benchmarks
    -   Investment-oriented reforms
-   Stabilization **with** a growth engine

---

## Conclusion

-   Stabilization without growth = stagnation
-   Growth is not a luxury â€” itâ€™s a necessity
-   Letâ€™s break the 40-year cycle
-   Move from **austerity** to **opportunity**

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Counter-Cyclical Fiscal Policy**

-   Instead of across-the-board austerity, use **targeted spending during downturns** (e.g. public works, employment programs).
-   Build fiscal buffers in good years, but **do not cut development spending** when the economy is already slowing.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Targeted Subsidy Reforms**

-   Rather than abrupt price hikes, implement **gradual subsidy reforms** with **digital targeting** (e.g. BISP, Ehsaas).
-   Protect the poor while adjusting prices â€” avoid demand shocks.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Inflation Management via Supply Chains**

-   Donâ€™t rely solely on high interest rates.
-   Address inflation by **removing supply bottlenecks** and improving logistics for food, energy, and imports.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Growth-Linked Conditionalities**

-   Negotiate IMF benchmarks that **reward investments in productivity**, exports, and digitalization.
-   Set reform goals around **tax base expansion**, not just tax rate hikes.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. **Strengthening Domestic Resource Mobilization**

-   Focus on **progressive tax reform**, not regressive indirect taxes.
-   Widen tax net (retail, real estate, agri) instead of squeezing formal sectors further.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 6. **Exchange Rate Anchoring with Export Support**

-   Let exchange rate adjust, but **actively support exporters** via rebates, trade facilitation, and low-interest loans.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 7. **Debt Restructuring / Reprofiling**

## Q&A

-   Ask me about:
    -   Alternatives to current stabilization approach
    -   Role of provinces in growth
    -   Youth employment strategy
    -   Social spending under IMF programs
## Opening Context

* Pakistan has entered **25 IMF programs** since 1988
* IMF focus has always been **stabilization**:

  * Tight monetary policy (high interest rates)
  * Fiscal austerity (tax hikes, subsidy cuts)
  * Utility price increases
  * Market-based exchange rate adjustments
* Economic crises repeatâ€”whatâ€™s missing?

---

## The Stabilization Trap

* **Repeated tools**:

  * High policy rates
  * Subsidy cuts
  * Currency devaluation
* **Consequences**:

  * Collapse in investment
  * Jobless or weak recovery
  * Squeezed development spending

---

## Tax & Fiscal Challenges

* **Rs. 704 billion** revenue shortfall under IMF second staff-level agreement
* Wealthy farmers, real estate, traders often **outside tax net**
* **Indirect tax hikes** drive up poverty
* Tax increase of **34%** in 2024â€“25: from Rs.11,800 billion to **projected 15,070 billion**

---

## Institutional & Expenditure Issues

* **Proliferation of agencies**:

  * New departments, ministries (35 federal ministers, 19 ministers of state)
  * Empty rental buildings, unused vehicles (Zakat dept: 30 cars; FBR: 2000 cars)
* **Outdated Rules of Business (1973)**
* **PSDP quagmire**: recurring vs development expenditure imbalance
* Cost overruns (Neelumâ€“Jhelum); idle projects should be closed

---

## The Missing Ingredient â€” Growth

* Stabilization **keeps the boat afloat**, but without growth:

  * No revenue expansion
  * No job creation for youth bulge
  * No fiscal space for defense, education, health
* Growth is a **long-term process**, not one-off (CPEC/minerals alone wonâ€™t suffice)

---

## Pathways to Sustainable Growth

1. **Human Capital**: education, skills training, health
2. **Business Climate**: cut red tape, enforce contracts, reduce over-/under-regulation
3. **Infrastructure**: energy, transport, digital connectivity
4. **Export Diversification**: beyond textilesâ€”IT, agritech, manufacturing
5. **Financial Inclusion**: credit access for SMEs, startups
6. **Land & Labor Reforms**: improve efficiency, attract FDI
7. **Tax Reform**: progressive, stable, broaden base (include agriculture, real estate)

---

## IMF Instruments & Critique

* **Four core instruments**:

  1. Tight monetary policy
  2. Tight fiscal policy
  3. Market-based exchange rate
  4. Utility price hikes
* Based on **Washington Consensus**â€”focus on balance of payments
* Pakistanâ€™s issues are **supply-side**; need demand-stimulating and structural reforms

---

## Governance & Long-Term Vision

* **Policy capture** and crony capitalism
* **Myopic thinking** for political survivalâ€”no shelf life for reforms
* Lack of **national narrative**:

  * Growth targets (education, health, jobs)
  * Clear vision: market-driven vs social welfare balance
* IMF technical meetings often dictate policy without **skin in the game**

---

## Recommendations for IMF Programs

* **Growth-linked benchmarks**: reward productivity, investment, export expansion
* **Counter-cyclical fiscal policy**: protect devâ€™t spending during downturns
* **Targeted subsidy reforms**: gradual, digitally targeted, protect vulnerable
* **Strengthen resource mobilization**: widen tax net, avoid regressive taxes
* **Export support**: rebates, trade facilitation, low-cost finance
* **PSDP restructuring**: output/outcome-based allocations, prioritize high-completion projects

---

## Conclusion

* **Stabilization without growth = stagnation**
* Growth is **not a luxury** but a **necessity**
* Break the **40-year cycle**: balance **austerity** with **opportunity**

---

## Q\&A

* Alternatives to current stabilization approach?
* Role of provinces in driving growth?
* Strategies for youth employment?
* Balancing social spending under IMF programs?
