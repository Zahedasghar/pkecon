## Why Census Matters: Pakistan's Decennial Health Check

::: {.columns}

:::: {.column width="60%"}
**Pakistan Census 2023** is a nationwide survey conducted every 10 years to measure the country's social and economic health—much like a doctor regularly monitors a child's growth and development over time.

:::: {.fragment}
### Critical Functions of Census Data

- **Electoral Boundaries**: Determines fair representation in national and provincial assemblies
- **Resource Allocation**: Drives National Finance Commission (NFC) award distribution among provinces
- **Employment Quotas**: Sets federal government job allocation across regions
- **Policy Planning**: Informs evidence-based decision making for national development

## Key Impact Areas

📊 **Demographics**  
Population size, age structure, household composition

💰 **Economic Planning**  
Budget allocation, infrastructure needs

🗳️ **Political Representation**  
Constituency delimitation, legislative seats

🎯 **Service Delivery**  
Healthcare, education, utilities planning

The census serves as Pakistan's most comprehensive data collection exercise, providing the foundation for evidence-based governance and equitable resource distribution across the federation.
