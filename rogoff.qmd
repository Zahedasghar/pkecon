  # The IMF Trap: 75 Years, 25 Programs
  
  ## Pakistan's Unique IMF Relationship
  
- **Never been out of an IMF program** in 75 years
- Currently on the **25th IMF program** since independence
- **Only country** that has never made independent economic policy

### The Geopolitical Reality
> **Kenneth Rogoff:** "Pakistan is geopolitically very important... If you don't sign off on bailout number 25, they're going to default on bailout number 24"

### The Honest Assessment
- **Rogoff's Recommendation:** Convert loans to direct aid
- **Reality:** "You're never going to collect the loans anyway"
- **The Pretense:** False accounting of "lending" when it's effectively aid

# The Mathematical Trap: Primary Surplus Problem

## When Austerity Becomes Self-Defeating

::: {style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;"}
**7%** Real Interest Rate | **3%** Growth Rate | **2.3%** Required Primary Surplus
:::

### The Vicious Cycle

1. **High Debt Burden** → Requires 2.3% GDP primary surplus annually
2. **Austerity Measures** → Higher taxes + Lower spending  
3. **Investment Collapse** → Falls from 8% to needed 25% of GDP
4. **Growth Stagnation** → Below 3%, worsening debt-to-GDP ratio
5. **Larger Surplus Required** → Cycle repeats and intensifies

### The Greece Model
- Greece mandated to maintain primary surpluses **until 2060**
- Same framework now applied to Pakistan
- **Policy Contradiction:** Using growth-killing measures to solve growth-dependent problem

# The FBR Crisis: Pakistan's Institutional Albatross

## Federal Board of Revenue Failures

### **The Damage Done**
- Single-handedly **shrunk formal sector** over 15-20 years
- **Boosted informal economy** that doesn't contribute to productivity, revenues, or FDI
- Gained **excessive discretionary powers** scaring genuine investors

### **Tax System Dysfunction**
- **Corporate tax rates too high** (should be halved)
- **13 different taxes** on single electricity bill
- Large segments operate **outside tax net** (professionals, doctors, lawyers)
- **Last 3 years:** Collected more taxes than previous **14 years combined**

### **The Regulatory Burden**
- **20 permissions required** to set up a restaurant
- **FBR permission needed** for property purchases above 5 crore
- Businesses forced to become **tax collection services** without refunds

# Investment Crisis: The 8% vs 25% Problem

## Why Pakistan Can't Grow

### **Current Investment Reality**
- **Private investment:** Only 8% of GDP
- **Target needed:** 25% of GDP for sustainable growth
- **Corporate sector:** Too small globally (MCB $800M, Habib Bank $1.2B)

### **Why Companies Stay Small**
> "I want to stay under the radar and don't want FBR to know me"
> - Engineering industry survey response

### **Policy Incentive Misalignment**
Current budget **incentivizes:**
- Trading over manufacturing
- Real estate/stock market over productive sectors  
- Capital flight and emigration for professionals
- Avoiding formal sector participation

**Result:** Companies deliberately keep low profile to avoid regulatory harassment

# Market Failures: Where Markets Don't Exist

## The Fundamental Problem

### **No Functioning Markets**
- **Real estate:** Opaque, broker-controlled, no information transparency
- **Property transactions:** Can take 10 years due to market dysfunction
- **All sectors:** Regulated by civil service generalists, not sector experts

### **Information Asymmetries**
- **Property buying:** "Flying in the dark" with corrupt intermediaries
- **No price discovery:** Unlike developed markets with transparent data
- **Stock market:** Run by civil service, not market professionals

### **Regulatory Capture**
- **122 regulatory agencies** in Islamabad (mostly World Bank-created)
- **Same people rotate** between positions after retirement
- **Example:** CDA official got free apartment for completion certificate

  # Exchange Rate: 67 Years of Overvaluation
  
  ## The Currency Mismanagement Pattern
  
  ### **Historical Pattern**
  - **Overvalued for 67 of 75 years** since independence
- **Export sector only 8%** of economy due to exchange rate policy
- **Series of crashes:** From defended rates to market reality

### **Current Issues**
- **Capital controls** with supply constraints ($1,000 hard to obtain)
- **Defending unsustainable rates** instead of gradual adjustment
- **Central bank reserves spent** on defense rather than accumulation

### **The Alternative Path**
- **East Asian model:** Deliberate undervaluation for growth
- **Switching mechanism:** Let exchange rate manage import/export balance
- **Accept inflation pass-through** (30-40%) for export competitiveness

  # Government Service Failures: The Infrastructure Gap
  
  ## What Government Doesn't Provide
  
  ### **Basic Service Failures**
  - **No macroeconomic stability** or political stability
- **Gas unavailable** 4 months annually  
- **Electricity:** Neither affordable nor reliably available
- **No protection** against smuggling, informal sector competition

### **Unfair Competition**
- **Informal sector pays 27-29% less** in taxes than formal sector
- **No enforcement** against misdeclaration of goods
- **Formal businesses** bear disproportionate regulatory burden

### **The Paradox**
> "I'm really amazed we have $30-35 billion of exports... under these circumstances I would expect exports to be close to zero"

  # Expenditure Explosion: The Hidden Crisis
  
  ## Where the Money Really Goes
  
  ### **Spending Mismanagement**
  - **Non-interest expenditure up 20%** despite austerity claims
- **65 new agencies created** in single fiscal year
- **PSTP expanded** to 4.5 trillion rupees nationally
- **No relationship** between PSTP spending and economic growth

### **Political Economy**
- **40% of budget discretionary** but finance minister claims "hands tied"
- **PSTP functions** as "pork barrel" list
- **Political bribes** and unjustified expenditures
- **No cost-benefit analysis** for development projects

### **The Opportunity Cost**
- Could have **reduced debt by couple trillion rupees** 
  - Instead: **Debt servicing increases** requiring more revenue collection

  # Institutional Dysfunction: The Governance Crisis
  
  ## The Root of All Problems
  
  ### **Bureaucratic Capture**
  - **Generalists regulating specialists:** Civil service controls energy, finance, all sectors
- **No sector expertise:** Energy people don't know energy, stock market people don't know markets
- **Rotation system:** Same people move between regulatory positions

### **Military's Economic Expansion**
- **Egyptian model:** Non-civilian side marching into economy
- **Commanding heights:** Taking over more economic sectors
- **Difficult rollback:** Even harder than civilian bureaucracy reform

### **Information Flow Failures**
- **Sugar/wheat policy:** Based on deliberately faulty stock information
- **ECC decisions:** Made without accurate data (15-minute phone calls for basic figures)
- **No regular reporting:** Unlike US commodity stock reports

  # The Way Forward: Competing Solutions
  
  ## Two Different Paths
  
  ### **Path 1: Debt Restructuring (Sakib's View)**
  - **IMF should offer debt restructuring** (as done for Greece)
- **Moral hazard concerns** but people's burden needs consideration
- **Pakistan should demand** debt rescheduling in negotiations
- **Precedent exists:** Greece, post-COVID developing country discussions

### **Path 2: Growth-First Strategy (Nadim's View)**
  - **Sharp deregulation:** Ban NOCs, eliminate inspector systems
- **Accept higher deficits** (7-8% GDP) if growth reaches 7-8%
                                - **Exchange rate depreciation:** Let market determine rate
                              - **Focus on investment:** 25% GDP target over tax collection
                              
                              ### **Kenneth Rogoff's Realism**
                              - **Convert to aid:** Stop pretending loans will be repaid
                              - **Acknowledge geopolitical reality:** Support continues regardless of economics
                              - **Institutional problems:** Cannot be solved by external intervention

                                # Key Takeaways: Breaking the Cycle
                                
                                ## What Needs to Change
                                
                                ### **Immediate Priorities**
                                1. **Exchange rate liberalization:** End the defend-and-crash cycle
                              2. **FBR restructuring:** Reduce discretionary powers, expand base
                              3. **Regulatory reform:** Sector experts, not generalists
                              4. **Investment incentives:** Shift from tax collection to productive investment
                              
                              ### **Structural Requirements**
                              1. **Institutional framework:** Support market functioning
                              2. **Political legitimacy:** Representative government for burden-sharing
                              3. **Information systems:** Regular, accurate economic data
                              4. **Military's economic role:** Rollback from business operations

### **The Reality Check**
> "Pakistan has a lot of very smart economists who know what to do... The issue isn't lack of technical knowledge but institutional and political constraints"

**Bottom Line:** Pakistan's problems are fundamentally **institutional and political**, not technical. Solutions exist, but implementation requires addressing power structures that benefit from the current dysfunction.
