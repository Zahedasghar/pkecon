## Executive Summary

Pakistan's economic trajectory faces critical challenges:

- **Structural inefficiencies** and short-termism
- **Collapsed domestic demand** disguised as inflation control
- **Strategic failure** in export performance
- **Institutional dysfunction** in trade development

**Core Thesis**: Shift from domestic survival to global competitiveness through innovation and exports

## The Export Performance Gap

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Pakistan's Reality
- Population: ~250 million
- Exports: ~$40 billion
- **$160 per capita export**

### Regional Comparison
- Bangladesh: $1.5B → $50B+ (1990-2024)
- Countries with half Pakistan's population export 5-10x more
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Key Question
*"This is not a trade gap but a strategic failure"*

**Research Need**: Comparative study of:
- Production costs
- Trade facilitation frameworks  
- Export incentives
- Market access policies
:::

::::

## Current Export Sector Challenges

### Policy-Induced Penalties
- **Excessive taxation** on exporters
- **Delayed refunds** creating cash flow issues
- **Unpredictable energy pricing**

### Urgent Policy Needs
- Reinstate reduced tax rates (at minimum for value-added manufacturing)
- **Zero-rated taxation** for services exports
- Stable long-term frameworks
- Access to global payment platforms

---

## The Innovation Deficit

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
### Current State
- Most firms operate **without structured R&D**
- No product development units
- No export-oriented design strategies
- Focus on basic, low-margin offerings

### Global Benchmark
- Leading companies: **25%+ revenue** from products not yet existing
- Pakistani reality: Locked into traditional offerings
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
### Recommended Targets
- Firms commit **2-3% revenue** to innovation
- Government co-finance:
  - Export-readiness programs
  - Sectoral innovation hubs
  - International certification support

- Simplified documentation
- Access to global payment platforms
- Digital infrastructure development

---

## Agricultural Export Opportunities

### Success Case: Sesame Seeds

## Institutional Failure: TDAP and EDF

### Export Development Fund Crisis
- **Export Development Surcharge**: 0.25% since early 1990s
- **Total collected**: Likely >Rs100 billion
- **Original purpose**: Infrastructure, innovation, capacity building

### Current Problems
- Fund remains **largely unused**
- Diverted to **unrelated government expenses**
- Spent on **non-strategic activities**
- **Zero transparency** on collection/spending/outcomes

---

## TDAP Reform Proposal

### Current Problems

### Proposed Solution: Corporate Restructure
- **Autonomous entity** with corporate governance
- Board chaired by **Prime Minister**
- **Private sector majority** on board
- **International CEO search** with trade expertise
- **Results-based evaluation** tied to export outcomes

---

## Proposed: Trade and Export Facilitation Organization

### Governance Structure
- **Independent framework**
- Exempt from PPRA rules
- **High-powered board** with distinguished trade records
- **Annual evaluations** tied to measurable outcomes

### Accountability Measures
- Focus on **impact, not activity**
- **Performance monitoring**
- **Continuous course correction**
