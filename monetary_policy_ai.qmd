# Pakistan's Monetary Transmission Analysis: 11% Policy Rate Assessment

## Executive Summary

Pakistan's State Bank has maintained the policy rate at 11% as of July 2025, despite inflation falling to 3.2% in June 2025, creating an exceptionally high real interest rate of approximately 7.8%. This analysis examines the effectiveness of monetary transmission channels under this restrictive policy stance.

**Key Findings:**
- **Interest Rate Channel**: Partial transmission with significant lags due to banking sector's preference for government securities
- **Credit Channel**: Severely constrained with weak private sector credit growth
- **Exchange Rate Channel**: Relatively effective in maintaining stability but reducing competitiveness  
- **Expectations Channel**: Successfully anchored inflation expectations but may be overdoing disinflation

## (a) Interest Rate Transmission to Commercial Lending Rates

### Current Transmission Framework

The SBP's transmission mechanism works through KIBOR (Karachi Interbank Offer Rates) as the primary benchmark for lending to consumers and businesses. However, the transmission efficiency has been significantly impaired by structural banking sector dynamics.

### Bank Category Analysis

**Large Commercial Banks:**
- **Public Sector Banks**: Slower transmission due to government ownership constraints and priority lending mandates
- **Private Sector Banks**: More responsive but limited by risk aversion and regulatory requirements
- **Foreign Banks**: Most efficient transmission but minimal market share

### Transmission Efficiency Issues

Despite steep policy rate reductions from the peak of 22% in mid-2023, the weighted average lending rate has hardly budged, signaling a muted transmission mechanism. Key impediments include:

1. **Government Securities Crowding-Out**: Banks prefer high-yield, risk-free government papers over private lending
2. **Regulatory Risk Weights**: Higher capital requirements for private sector lending
3. **Information Asymmetries**: Limited credit information systems constraining lending decisions

### Recommended Time-Series Analysis

**Methodology for R/Python Implementation:**
```r
# Key variables for transmission analysis
# policy_rate, kibor_3m, lending_rate_weighted, deposit_rates
# Use Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) for cointegration analysis

library(vars)
library(urca)

# Test for structural breaks in transmission efficiency
library(strucchange)
breakpoint_test <- breakpoints(lending_rate ~ policy_rate + lag(policy_rate))

# Calculate pass-through coefficients by period
transmission_efficiency <- lm(delta_lending_rate ~ delta_policy_rate + 
                             lag(delta_policy_rate, 1:3))
```

**Expected Findings:**
- Pass-through coefficient of 0.4-0.6 (incomplete transmission)
- Transmission lags of 3-6 months for deposit rates, 6-12 months for lending rates
- Structural break likely around 2020-2021 due to COVID-19 and subsequent policy changes

## (b) Credit Channel Responsiveness and Sectoral Allocation

### Credit Growth Patterns

Credit to the private sector is expected to gradually recover, primarily driven by improved demand in major industries such as wholesale & retail trade and manufacturing of food products. However, the current 11% policy rate continues to constrain credit expansion.

### Sectoral Impact Analysis

**Manufacturing Sector:**
- **Large Enterprises**: Better access due to collateral and credit history, but investment decisions delayed
- **SMEs**: Severely constrained access; effective borrowing costs exceed 15-18%
- **Export-Oriented**: Relatively better due to SBP's export refinance schemes

**Agriculture:**
- Seasonal credit needs unmet due to high financing costs
- Shift toward informal financing mechanisms
- Government subsidy schemes partially offsetting rate impact

**Services Sector:**
- Consumer financing severely impacted (auto, housing)
- IT/Digital services showing resilience due to export earnings
- Traditional services (retail, hospitality) facing credit constraints

### Financial Inclusion Implications

**Spatial Disparities:**
- Urban vs. rural credit access gap widening
- Branch banking retreating from remote areas
- Mobile banking partially compensating but limited to basic services

**Demographic Impact:**
- Youth entrepreneurship constrained by high borrowing costs
- Women-owned businesses disproportionately affected
- Low-income households pushed toward informal lending

### Analytical Framework for Credit Channel

```python
# Sectoral credit allocation analysis
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from statsmodels.tsa.vector_ar.var_model import VAR

# Variables: policy_rate, manufacturing_credit, agriculture_credit, 
# services_credit, sme_credit_share

# Impulse Response Analysis
var_model = VAR(credit_data)
irf_results = var_model.irf(periods=12)
```

## (c) Exchange Rate Channel and External Competitiveness

### Exchange Rate Stability vs. Competitiveness Trade-off

Pakistan's Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) was 104.0 in January 2025, indicating reduced competitiveness compared to the 2010 baseline. The USD/PKR exchange rate has remained relatively stable around 283-285 levels.

### Impact Analysis

**Positive Aspects:**
- **Inflation Control**: Stable exchange rate contributing to disinflation
- **Import Costs**: Changes in interest rates have a direct effect on inflation by influencing the prices of imported goods and services
- **Debt Sustainability**: Reduced pressure on external debt servicing

**Negative Consequences:**
- **Export Competitiveness**: REER above 100 indicates overvaluation relative to trading partners
- **Current Account**: SBP projects a manageable deficit of up to 1% of GDP for the new fiscal year, largely due to increased imports
- **Industrial Competitiveness**: Manufacturing sector struggling with cost competitiveness

### Transmission Mechanism Assessment

**Interest Rate-Exchange Rate Nexus:**
1. High interest rates attract short-term capital inflows
2. Reduced depreciation pressure on PKR
3. Import-dependent inflation contained
4. Export sector competitiveness deteriorated

### Policy Implications

The exchange rate channel has been **overly effective** in maintaining stability at the expense of external competitiveness. An increase in REER indicates reduced competitiveness for the reporting economy, which Pakistan is currently experiencing.

## (d) Expectations Channel and Inflation Anchoring

### Inflation Expectations Success

The expectations channel has been remarkably successful in anchoring inflation expectations. Inflation stands at 3.2% as of June, down from 3.5% in May, with average inflation for the last fiscal year dropping to 4.49%—a nine-year low after peaking at 38% in 2023.

### Forward-Looking Assessment

**Central Bank Credibility:**
- Successfully established anti-inflation credentials
- Market expectations well-anchored within 3-5% range
- Credible central bank with a history of success in curtailing inflationary pressure can influence market expectations about future inflation

**Over-Anchoring Risks:**
- Inflation expectations may be **too low** relative to growth objectives
- Risk of deflationary psychology if rates remain elevated
- Growth-inflation trade-off tilted excessively toward price stability

### Structural Break Analysis

**Pre-2023 vs. Post-2023 Regime:**
- **2020-2022**: High inflation, weak credibility, poor expectations anchoring
- **2023-2025**: Aggressive tightening, credibility rebuilt, expectations well-anchored
- **Structural Break**: Likely around mid-2023 when policy credibility was reestablished

- Banking sector indicators (NPLs, CAR, deposits)

---

## Policy Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next 6 Months)

1. **Gradual Rate Reduction**: Move to 9-10% to maintain real rates around 5-6%
2. **Transmission Enhancement**: 
   - Reduce regulatory risk weights on private sector lending
   - Introduce lending growth targets for banks
3. **Sectoral Support**: Enhanced refinance schemes for manufacturing and agriculture

### Medium-term Reforms (1-2 Years)

1. **Banking Sector Diversification**: Reduce dependence on government securities
2. **Credit Information Systems**: Improve information asymmetries
3. **Competition Enhancement**: Encourage new entrants and fintech solutions

### Long-term Structural Changes

1. **Fiscal-Monetary Coordination**: Reduce government borrowing requirements
2. **Financial Market Development**: Develop corporate bond markets
3. **Exchange Rate Flexibility**: Allow gradual depreciation to restore competitiveness

---

## Conclusion

Pakistan's current monetary policy stance represents a **successful but excessive** tightening cycle. While inflation has been controlled and expectations anchored, the 7.8% real interest rate is constraining growth and private investment. The transmission mechanism shows **asymmetric effectiveness**—strong in controlling inflation and maintaining exchange rate stability, but weak in supporting credit growth and economic activity.

**Bottom Line**: The SBP should begin a gradual easing cycle while maintaining credibility, targeting a real interest rate of 4-5% to balance price stability with growth objectives.
