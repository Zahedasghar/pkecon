## Opening Context

- Pakistan has entered 25 IMF programs since 1988
- IMF focus has always been **stabilization**:
  - Monetary tightening
  - Fiscal austerity
  - Utility price hikes
  - Market-based exchange rate
- Yet, economic crises repeat — why?

---

## The Stabilization Trap

- Tools used repeatedly:
  - High interest rates
  - Cuts to subsidies
  - Currency devaluation
- Consequences:
  - Investment collapse
  - Jobless recovery
  - Development spending squeezed

---

## What Stabilization Achieves

- Inflation control (short-term)
- FX reserve buildup
- Signals to donors and IFIs
- BUT:
  - Temporary
  - Lacks sustainable growth impact

---

## The Missing Ingredient — Growth

- Without growth:
  - No revenue expansion
  - No employment generation
  - No fiscal room for defense, education, health
- Youth bulge = risk if opportunities don’t grow

---

## What Growth Requires

1. **Human Capital**
   - Education, health, skills
2. **Business Climate Reforms**
   - Reduce red tape, enforce contracts
3. **Export Diversification**
   - Beyond textiles: IT, value-added agri, manufacturing
4. **Infrastructure**
   - Energy, transport, connectivity
5. **Credit Access**
   - Support for SMEs and startups

## IMF: Need for a New Lens

- Stabilization must **enable**, not strangle growth
- IMF conditionalities should:
  - Incentivize investment
  - Avoid pro-cyclical cuts
  - Support productivity reforms

---

## Sectoral Impact

- **Defense**: Needs long-term fiscal space
- **Education & Health**: Get cut during austerity
- **Youth**: Face rising unemployment
- **Women**: Bear cost of inflation, services withdrawal

---

## A Path Forward

- National consensus on long-term economic strategy
- Push for IMF programs with:
  - Growth-linked benchmarks
  - Investment-oriented reforms
- Stabilization **with** a growth engine

---

## Conclusion

- Stabilization without growth = stagnation
- Growth is not a luxury — it’s a necessity
- Let’s break the 40-year cycle
- Move from **austerity** to **opportunity**
